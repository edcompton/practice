## More on references

References are very important in Rust. Rust uses references to make sure that all memory access is safe. We know that we use `&` to create a reference:

```rust
fn main() {
    let country = String::from("Austria");
    let ref_one = &country;
    let ref_two = &country;

    println!("{}", ref_one);
}
```

`country` is a `String`. We created two references to `country`. They have the type `&String`: a "reference to a String". We could create one hundred references to `country` and it would be no problem.

But this is a problem:

```rust
fn main() {
    let country = return_str();
}

fn return_str() -> &str {
    let country = String::from("Austria");
    let country_ref = &country;
    country_ref // ⚠️
}
```

The function `return_str()` creates a String, then it creates a reference to the string. Then it tries to return the reference. But `country` only lives inside the function. So after the function is over, `country_ref` is referring to memory that is already gone. Rust prevents us from making a mistake with memory.
