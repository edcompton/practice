## RwLock

`RwLock` means "read write lock". It is like a `Mutex` but also like a `RefCell`. You use `.write().unwrap()` instead of `.lock().unwrap()` to change it. But you can also use `.read().unwrap()` to get read access. It is like `RefCell` because it follows the rules:

- many `.read()` variables is okay,
- one `.write()` variable is okay,
- but more than one `.read()` or `.read()` together with `.write()` is not okay.

The program will run forever if you try to `.write()` when you can't get access:

```rust
use std::sync::RwLock;

fn main() {
    let my_rwlock = RwLock::new(5);

    let read1 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap(); // one .read() is fine
    let read2 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap(); // two .read()s is also fine

    println!("{:?}, {:?}", read1, read2);

    let write1 = my_rwlock.write().unwrap(); // uh oh, now the program will wait forever
}
```

So we use `std::mem::drop`, just like in a `Mutex`.

```rust
use std::sync::RwLock;
use std::mem::drop; // We will use drop() many times

fn main() {
    let my_rwlock = RwLock::new(5);

    let read1 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap();
    let read2 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap();

    println!("{:?}, {:?}", read1, read2);

    drop(read1);
    drop(read2); // we dropped both, so we can use .write() now

    let mut write1 = my_rwlock.write().unwrap();
    *write1 = 6;
    drop(write1);
    println!("{:?}", my_rwlock);
}
```

And you can use `try_read()` and `try_write()` too.

```rust
use std::sync::RwLock;

fn main() {
    let my_rwlock = RwLock::new(5);

    let read1 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap();
    let read2 = my_rwlock.read().unwrap();

    if let Ok(mut number) = my_rwlock.try_write() {
        *number += 10;
        println!("Now the number is {}", number);
    } else {
        println!("Couldn't get write access, sorry!")
    };
}
```
