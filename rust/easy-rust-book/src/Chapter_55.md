## Channels

A channel is an easy way to use many threads that send to one place. You can create a channel in Rust with `std::sync::mpsc`. `mpsc` means "multiple producer, single consumer", so "many threads sending to one place". To start a channel, you use `channel()`. This creates a `Sender` and a `Receiver` that are tied together. You can see this in the function signature:

```rust
// üöß
pub fn channel<T>() -> (Sender<T>, Receiver<T>)
```

So you have to choose one name for the sender and one for the receiver. Usually you see `let (sender, receiver) = channel();` to start. Because it's generic, Rust won't know the type if that is all you write:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = channel(); // ‚ö†Ô∏è
}
```

The compiler says:

```text
error[E0282]: type annotations needed for `(std::sync::mpsc::Sender<T>, std::sync::mpsc::Receiver<T>)`
  --> src\main.rs:30:30
   |
30 |     let (sender, receiver) = channel();
   |         ------------------   ^^^^^^^ cannot infer type for type parameter `T` declared on the function `channel`
   |         |
   |         consider giving this pattern the explicit type `(std::sync::mpsc::Sender<T>, std::sync::mpsc::Receiver<T>)`, where
the type parameter `T` is specified
```

It suggests adding a type for the `Sender` and `Receiver`. You can do that if you want:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::{channel, Sender, Receiver}; // Added Sender and Receiver here

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver): (Sender<i32>, Receiver<i32>) = channel();
}
```

but you don't have to. Once you start using the `Sender` and `Receiver`, Rust can guess the type.

So let's look at the simplest way to use a channel.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = channel();

    sender.send(5);
    receiver.recv();
}
```

Now the compiler knows the type. `sender` is a `Result<(), SendError<i32>>` and `receiver` is a `Result<i32, RecvError`. So you can use `unwrap` to see if the sending works, or use better error handling. Let's add `.unwrap()` and also `println!` to see what we get:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = channel();

    sender.send(5).unwrap();
    println!("{}", receiver.recv().unwrap());
}
```

This prints `5`.

A `channel` is like an `Arc` because you can clone it and send the clones into other threads. Let's make two threads and send values to `receiver`. This code will work, but it is not exactly what we want.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = channel();
    let sender_clone = sender.clone();

    std::thread::spawn(move|| { // move sender in
        sender.send("Send a &str this time").unwrap();
    });

    std::thread::spawn(move|| { // move sender_clone in
        sender_clone.send("And here is another &str");
    });

    println!("{}", receiver.recv().unwrap());
}
```

The two threads start sending, and then we `println!`. Sometimes it will say `Send a &str this time` and sometimes it will say `And here is another &str`. Let's make a join handle to make them wait.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = channel();
    let sender_clone = sender.clone();
    let mut handle_vec = vec![]; // Put our handles in here

    handle_vec.push(std::thread::spawn(move|| {  // push this into the vec
        sender.send("Send a &str this time").unwrap();
    }));

    handle_vec.push(std::thread::spawn(move|| {  // and push this into the vec
        sender_clone.send("And here is another &str").unwrap();
    }));

    for _ in handle_vec { // now handle_vec has 2 items. Let's print them
        println!("{:?}", receiver.recv().unwrap());
    }
}
```

This prints:

```text
"Send a &str this time"
"And here is another &str"
```

Now let's make a `results_vec` instead of printing.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = channel();
    let sender_clone = sender.clone();
    let mut handle_vec = vec![];
    let mut results_vec = vec![];

    handle_vec.push(std::thread::spawn(move|| {
        sender.send("Send a &str this time").unwrap();
    }));

    handle_vec.push(std::thread::spawn(move|| {
        sender_clone.send("And here is another &str").unwrap();
    }));

    for _ in handle_vec {
        results_vec.push(receiver.recv().unwrap());
    }

    println!("{:?}", results_vec);
}
```

Now the results are in our vec: `["Send a &str this time", "And here is another &str"]`.

Now let's pretend that we have a lot of work to do, and want to use threads. We have a big vec with 10,000 items, all 0. We want to change each 0 to a 1. We will use ten threads, and each thread will do one tenth of the work. We will create a new vec and use `.extend()` to put the work in.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = channel();
    let hugevec = vec![0; 1000];
    let mut newvec = vec![];

    for i in 0..10 {
        let sender_clone = sender.clone();
        let mut work: Vec<u8> = Vec::with_capacity(hugevec.len() / 10); // new vec to put the work in. 1/10th the size
        work.extend(&hugevec[i*100..(i+1)*100]); // first part gets 0..100, next gets 100..200, etc.
        let handle = std::thread::spawn(move || { // make a handle

            for number in work.iter_mut() { // do the actual work
                *number += 1;
            };
            sender_clone.send(work).unwrap(); // use the sender_clone to send the work to the receiver
        });

        handle.join().unwrap(); // stop the thread until it's done
        newvec.push(receiver.recv().unwrap()); // push the results from receiver.recv() into the vec
    }

    // Now we have a Vec<Vec<u8>>. To put it together we can use .flatten()
    let newvec = newvec.into_iter().flatten().collect::<Vec<u8>>(); // Now it's one vec of 1000 u8 numbers
}
```

If you print this you can see 1000 number 1s.
