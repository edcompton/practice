## HashSet and BTreeSet

A `HashSet` is actually a `HashMap` that only has keys. On [the page for HashSet](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html) it explains this on the top:

`A hash set implemented as a HashMap where the value is ().`

You often use a `HashSet` if you just want to know if a key exists, or doesn't exist.

Imagine that you have 100 random numbers, and each number between 1 and 100. If you do this, some numbers will appear more than once, while some won't appear at all. If you put them into a `HashSet` then you will have a list of all the numbers that appeared.

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn main() {
    let many_numbers = vec![
        94, 42, 59, 64, 32, 22, 38, 5, 59, 49, 15, 89, 74, 29, 14, 68, 82, 80, 56, 41, 36, 81, 66,
        51, 58, 34, 59, 44, 19, 93, 28, 33, 18, 46, 61, 76, 14, 87, 84, 73, 71, 29, 94, 10, 35, 20,
        35, 80, 8, 43, 79, 25, 60, 26, 11, 37, 94, 32, 90, 51, 11, 28, 76, 16, 63, 95, 13, 60, 59,
        96, 95, 55, 92, 28, 3, 17, 91, 36, 20, 24, 0, 86, 82, 58, 93, 68, 54, 80, 56, 22, 67, 82,
        58, 64, 80, 16, 61, 57, 14, 11];

    let mut number_hashset = HashSet::new();

    for number in many_numbers {
        number_hashset.insert(number);
    }

    let hashset_length = number_hashset.len(); // The length tells us how many numbers are in it
    println!("There are {} unique numbers, so we are missing {}.", hashset_length, 100 - hashset_length);

    // Let's see what numbers we are missing
    let mut missing_vec = vec![];
    for number in 0..100 {
        if number_hashset.get(&number).is_none() { // If .get() returns None,
            missing_vec.push(number);
        }
    }

    print!("It does not contain: ");
    for number in missing_vec {
        print!("{} ", number);
    }
}
```

This prints:

```text
There are 66 unique numbers, so we are missing 34.
It does not contain: 1 2 4 6 7 9 12 21 23 27 30 31 39 40 45 47 48 50 52 53 62 65 69 70 72 75 77 78 83 85 88 97 98 99 
```

A `BTreeSet` is similar to a `HashSet` in the same way that a `BTreeMap` is similar to a `HashMap`. If we print each item in the `HashSet`, we don't know what the order will be:

```rust
for entry in number_hashset { // ðŸš§
    print!("{} ", entry);
}
```

Maybe it will print this: `67 28 42 25 95 59 87 11 5 81 64 34 8 15 13 86 10 89 63 93 49 41 46 57 60 29 17 22 74 43 32 38 36 76 71 18 14 84 61 16 35 90 56 54 91 19 94 44 3 0 68 80 51 92 24 20 82 26 58 33 55 96 37 66 79 73`. But it will almost never print it in the same way again.

Here as well, it is easy to change your `HashSet` to a `BTreeSet` if you decide you need ordering. For our code, we only change two places.

```rust
use std::collections::BTreeSet; // Change HashSet to BTreeSet

fn main() {
    let many_numbers = vec![
        94, 42, 59, 64, 32, 22, 38, 5, 59, 49, 15, 89, 74, 29, 14, 68, 82, 80, 56, 41, 36, 81, 66,
        51, 58, 34, 59, 44, 19, 93, 28, 33, 18, 46, 61, 76, 14, 87, 84, 73, 71, 29, 94, 10, 35, 20,
        35, 80, 8, 43, 79, 25, 60, 26, 11, 37, 94, 32, 90, 51, 11, 28, 76, 16, 63, 95, 13, 60, 59,
        96, 95, 55, 92, 28, 3, 17, 91, 36, 20, 24, 0, 86, 82, 58, 93, 68, 54, 80, 56, 22, 67, 82,
        58, 64, 80, 16, 61, 57, 14, 11];

    let mut number_btreeset = BTreeSet::new(); // Change HashSet to BTreeSet

    for number in many_numbers {
        number_btreeset.insert(number);
    }
    for entry in number_btreeset {
        print!("{} ", entry);
    }
}
```

Now it will print in order.
