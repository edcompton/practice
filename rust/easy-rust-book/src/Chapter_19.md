## Vectors

In the same way that we have `&str` and `String`, we have arrays and vectors. Arrays are faster with less functionality, and vectors are slower with more functionality. The type is written `Vec`.

There are two main ways to declare a vector. One is like with `String` using `new`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let name1 = String::from("Windy");
    let name2 = String::from("Gomesy");

    let mut my_vec = Vec::new();
    // If we run the program now, the compiler will give an error.
    // It doesn't know the type of vec.

    my_vec.push(name1); // Now it knows: it's Vec<String>
    my_vec.push(name2);
}
```

Or you can just declare the type.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut my_vec: Vec<String> = Vec::new(); // The compiler knows the type
                                              // so there is no error.
}
```

You can see that items in vectors must have the same type.

Another easy way to create a vector is with the `vec!` macro. It looks like an array declaration, but has `vec!` in front of it.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut my_vec = vec![8, 10, 10];
}
```

The type is `Vec<i32>`. You call it a "vec of i32s". And a `Vec<String>` is a "vec of strings". And a `Vec<Vec<String>>` is a "vec of a vec of strings".

You can slice a vector too, just like in an array.

```rust
fn main() {
    let vec_of_ten = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    // Everything is the same except we added vec!
    let three_to_five = &vec_of_ten[2..5];
    let start_at_two = &vec_of_ten[1..];
    let end_at_five = &vec_of_ten[..5];
    let everything = &vec_of_ten[..];

    println!("Three to five: {:?},
start at two: {:?}
end at five: {:?}
everything: {:?}", three_to_five, start_at_two, end_at_five, everything);
}
```

Because a vec is slower than an array, we can use some methods to make it faster. A vec has a **capacity**, which means the space given to the vector. If you add more to a vector than its capacity, it will make its capacity double and copy the items into the new space. This is called reallocation.

For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut num_vec = Vec::new();
    num_vec.push('a'); // add one character
    println!("{}", num_vec.capacity()); // prints 1
    num_vec.push('a'); // add one more
    println!("{}", num_vec.capacity()); // prints 2
    num_vec.push('a'); // add one more
    println!("{}", num_vec.capacity()); // prints 4. It has three elements, but capacity is 4
    num_vec.push('a'); // add one more
    num_vec.push('a'); // add one more // Now we have 5 elements
    println!("{}", num_vec.capacity()); // Now capacity is 8
}
```

So this vector has three reallocations: 1 to 2, 2 to 4, and 4 to 8. We can make it faster:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut num_vec = Vec::with_capacity(8); // Give it capacity 8
    num_vec.push('a'); // add one character
    println!("{}", num_vec.capacity()); // prints 8
    num_vec.push('a'); // add one more
    println!("{}", num_vec.capacity()); // prints 8
    num_vec.push('a'); // add one more
    println!("{}", num_vec.capacity()); // prints 8.
    num_vec.push('a'); // add one more
    num_vec.push('a'); // add one more // Now we have 5 elements
    println!("{}", num_vec.capacity()); // Still 8
}
```

This vector has 0 reallocations, which is better. So if you think you know how many elements you need, you can use `Vec::with_capacity()` to make it faster.

You remember that you can use `.into()` to make a `&str` into a `String`. You can also use it to make an array into a `Vec`. You have to tell `.into()` that you want a `Vec`, but you don't have to choose the type of `Vec`. If you don't want to choose, you can write `Vec<_>`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_vec: Vec<u8> = [1, 2, 3].into();
    let my_vec2: Vec<_> = [9, 0, 10].into(); // Vec<_> means "choose the Vec type for me"
                                             // Rust will choose Vec<i32>
}
```
