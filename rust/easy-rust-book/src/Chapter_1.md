## Writing Easy Rust

It is now mid-August, and *Easy Rust* is almost 400 pages long. I am still writing it so there will be much more content. I plan to finish writing the main content by around August 15. You can contact me here or [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davemacleod) if you have any questions.  I am a Canadian who lives in Korea, and as I write Easy Rust I think of how to make it easy for companies here to start using it. I hope that other countries that don't use English as a first language can use it too.

# Part 1 - Rust in your browser

This book has two parts. In Part 1, you will learn as much Rust as you can just in your browser. You can actually learn almost everything you need to know without installing Rust. That's why Part 1 is much longer than Part 2. Then at the end is Part 2, which is Rust on your computer. That's where you will learn everything else you need to know that you can only do outside of a browser. Some examples of that are working with files or taking user input, graphics, and personal settings. The book makes Part 1 really long so that by the time you finish it you will like Rust enough that you will install it. And if you don't, no problem - Part 1 teaches you so much that you won't mind.
