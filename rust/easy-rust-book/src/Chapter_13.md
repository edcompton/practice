## const and static

There are two types that don't use `let` to declare: `const` and `static`. Also, you need to write the type for them. These are for variables that don't change (`const` means constant). The difference is that:

- `const` is a value that does not change,
- `static` is a value that does not change and has a fixed memory location.

So they are almost the same. Rust programmers almost always use `const`.

You write them with ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, and usually outside of the `main` function.

Two examples are: `const NUMBER_OF_MONTHS: u32 = 12;` and `const SEASONS: [&str; 4] = ["Spring", "Summer", "Fall", "Winter"];`
